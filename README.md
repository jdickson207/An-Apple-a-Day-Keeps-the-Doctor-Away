### KNN classification of patient data to predict readmission rates to hospitals based on medical conditions and survey responses in Python.
### What is a KNN? 
### According to DataCamp, a KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm (does not need any training data points for model generation) where non-parametric means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution. Simply put, the model structure is determined from the dataset. In the real world, this quite helpful in practice because most of the datasets do not follow mathematical theoretical assumptions. All training data used in the testing phase.
